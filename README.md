# 🔐 Cyber Security Final Year Project – Secure Network Infrastructure

This project represents my final year capstone in **Cyber Security**, where I designed and implemented a **secure cloud-based network infrastructure** for a **hypothetical organization**. The project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, automated, and secure environments using industry-standard tools.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal was to simulate a real-world company environment and apply my knowledge to:
- Architect a secure infrastructure on **Amazon AWS**
- Automate deployment with **Terraform**
- Monitor and analyze system logs using **Elasticsearch**

This repository includes Infrastructure as Code (IaC), documentation, and configurations reflecting a best-practice approach to cybersecurity in cloud environments.
